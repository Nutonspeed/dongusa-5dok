## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### **Database Optimization Strategy**
\`\`\`sql
-- Key indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_products_category_status 
ON products(category_id, status) WHERE status = 'active';

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_orders_user_date 
ON orders(user_id, created_at DESC);

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_fabrics_collection_available 
ON fabrics(collection_id, is_available) WHERE is_available = true;
\`\`\`

### **Connection Pooling Configuration**
\`\`\`typescript
const supabaseConfig = {
  db: {
    poolSize: 20,
    idleTimeoutMillis: 30000,
    connectionTimeoutMillis: 2000,
    maxUses: 7500
  },
  auth: {
    persistSession: true,
    autoRefreshToken: true,
    detectSessionInUrl: true
  }
}
\`\`\`

### **Caching Strategy**
\`\`\`typescript
const cacheConfig = {
  // Static data cache (24 hours)
  categories: { ttl: 86400 },
  fabrics: { ttl: 86400 },
  
  // Dynamic data cache (5 minutes)
  products: { ttl: 300 },
  inventory: { ttl: 300 },
  
  // User-specific cache (1 hour)
  userPreferences: { ttl: 3600 },
  cartItems: { ttl: 3600 }
}
