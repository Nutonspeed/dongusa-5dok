## üß™ Automated Testing

### Unit Tests
\`\`\`bash
npm run test
\`\`\`

### Integration Tests
\`\`\`bash
npm run test:integration
\`\`\`

### End-to-End Tests
\`\`\`bash
npm run test:e2e
\`\`\`

### Performance Tests
\`\`\`bash
npm run test:performance
\`\`\`

## üîß System Health Check

Run the comprehensive system health check:

\`\`\`bash
npm run health-check
\`\`\`

This will verify:
- Environment variables
- Database connectivity
- API endpoints
- File structure
- TypeScript compilation
- Critical functionality

## üìä Monitoring & Alerts

### Production Monitoring
- [ ] Uptime monitoring is configured
- [ ] Error tracking is set up
- [ ] Performance monitoring is active
- [ ] Database performance is monitored
- [ ] API response times are tracked

### Alert Thresholds
- [ ] Error rate > 1%
- [ ] Response time > 2 seconds
- [ ] Database connection failures
- [ ] Payment processing failures
- [ ] High memory/CPU usage

## üöÄ Deployment Process

### Pre-Deployment
1. Run full test suite
2. Execute system health check
3. Verify environment variables
4. Check database migrations

### Deployment
1. Deploy to staging environment
2. Run smoke tests
3. Verify critical user journeys
4. Check integrations (Supabase, Facebook)
5. Deploy to production
6. Monitor for issues

### Post-Deployment
1. Verify site is accessible
2. Check critical functionality
3. Monitor error rates
4. Verify analytics tracking
5. Test payment processing
6. Check email notifications
