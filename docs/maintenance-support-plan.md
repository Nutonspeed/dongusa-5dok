### Operational Budget Breakdown

```typescript
interface OperationalBudget {
  annual_costs: {
    infrastructure: {
      cloud_services: "$72,000"; // AWS, Supabase, CDN
      monitoring_tools: "$24,000"; // New Relic, DataDog
      security_tools: "$18,000"; // Security scanners, certificates
    };

    human_resources: {
      support_team: "$180,000"; // 4 FTE support staff
      maintenance_team: "$240,000"; // 3 FTE technical staff
      training_budget: "$30,000"; // Continuous learning
    };

    third_party_services: {
      payment_processing: "$36,000"; // Transaction fees
      communication_services: "$12,000"; // SMS, email
      backup_storage: "$8,000"; // Long-term data retention
    };

    contingency: "$50,000"; // 10% buffer for unexpected costs
  };

  total_annual_budget: "$670,000";
}
```

### Resource Allocation Strategy

```typescript
interface ResourceAllocation {
  team_structure: {
    maintenance_lead: {
      allocation: "100%";
      responsibilities: [
        "Team coordination",
        "Strategic planning",
        "Stakeholder communication",
      ];
    };

    system_administrators: {
      allocation: "200%"; // 2 FTE
      responsibilities: [
        "Infrastructure management",
        "Performance optimization",
        "Security maintenance",
      ];
    };

    application_support: {
      allocation: "100%";
      responsibilities: [
        "Bug fixes",
        "Minor enhancements",
        "Integration maintenance",
      ];
    };

    customer_support: {
      allocation: "400%"; // 4 FTE
      responsibilities: ["User support", "Documentation", "Training delivery"];
    };
  };

  skill_development: {
    cloud_technologies: "Priority focus for system administrators";
    customer_service: "Continuous improvement for support team";
    emerging_technologies: "Innovation time allocation for all technical staff";
  };
}
```
